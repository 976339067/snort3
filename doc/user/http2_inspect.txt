Snort 3 is developing an inspector for HTTP/2.

You can configure it by adding:

    http2_inspect = {}

to your snort.lua configuration file.

To smooth the transition to inspecting HTTP/2, rules that specify 
service:http will be treated as if they also specify service:http2. 
Thus:

    alert tcp any any -> any any (flow:established, to_server;
    http_uri; content:"/foo"; 
    service: http; sid:10; rev:1;)

is understood to mean:

    alert tcp any any -> any any (flow:established, to_server; 
    http_uri; content:"/foo"; 
    service: http,http2; sid:10; rev:1;)

Thus it will alert on "/foo" in the URI for both HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 traffic.

The reverse is not true. "service: http2" without http will match on HTTP/2 
flows but not HTTP/1 flows.

This feature makes it easy to add HTTP/2 inspection without modifying 
large numbers of existing rules. New rules should explicitly specify 
"service http,http2;" if that is the desired behavior. Eventually 
support for http implies http2 may be deprecated and removed.
